### A3-Sensitive Data Exposure

- Applications can unintentionally leak information about their **configuration**, **internal working**, or **violate privacy** through a variety of application problems
- Attackers use this weakness to steal sensitive data or conduct more serious attacks

- Prevent display of detailed internal error messages including **stack traces**, messages with **database** or **table names, protocols**, and other error codes. (This can provice attackers clues as to potential flaws)
- Provide short error messages to the user while logging detailed error information to an internal log file
- Encrypt all data **in transit** and **at rest**
- Use **secure** protocols and algorithms
- Disable caching of responses with sensitive data
